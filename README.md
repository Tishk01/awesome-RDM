# Awesome RDM

"Awesome Research Data Management" is  a curated list of awesome RDM resources for researchers and organizations.

## Definitions

"**Research data** are objects that you use and produce during your research life cycle, encompassing datasets, software, code, workflow, models, figures, tables, images and videos, interviews, articles. Data are your research asset." [The Turing Way / Guide for Reproducible Research / Research Data Management / Research Data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-data.html)

**Research "data management** refers to the storage, access and preservation of data produced from a given investigation. Data management practices cover the entire lifecycle of the data, from planning the investigation to conducting it, and from backing up data as it is created and used to long term preservation of data deliverables after the research investigation has concluded. Specific activities and issues that fall within the category of data management include: File naming (the proper way to name computer files); data quality control and quality assurance; data access; data documentation (including levels of uncertainty); metadata creation and controlled vocabularies; data storage; data archiving and preservation; data sharing and reuse; data integrity; data security; data privacy; data rights; notebook protocols (lab or field)." [CODATA RDM-Terminology / RDM](https://codata.org/rdm-terminology/research-data-management)

In a wider sense research data management include also research information management and research knowledge management.
